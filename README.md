**Flight Price Prediction**




**Overview**




This project is a flight price prediction system that leverages machine learning regression techniques to provide accurate and valuable insights into flight ticket pricing. By analyzing historical flight data and various influencing factors, the system aims to predict the price of flight tickets, helping travelers make informed decisions about their travel plans.

**Features**
Data Collection:I collected a comprehensive dataset of flight information, including departure and arrival locations, airline details, flight duration, and more.

**Data Preprocessing:** The data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for machine learning. We handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and performed feature engineering to enhance model performance.

**Model Building**:



I experimented with various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to develop accurate price prediction models.

**Evaluation Metrics**:



To assess model performance, I used metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

**Visualization**:



I created insightful visualizations to understand the relationships between different features and the flight prices. These visualizations help TO identify trends and patterns in the data.



Dataset




The project utilizes a publicly available flight dataset containing information on thousands of flights. The dataset includes attributes such as departure and arrival cities, flight durations, layovers, airlines, and more.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Scikit-Learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Flask (for web deployment)
Model Performance





My best-performing regression model achieved an R-squared (R2) score of 98% on the test dataset, indicating that our model performed very well on the testing data.
